       "'When investors think defense, they think utility stocks.The S&P; 500\\'s utility sector behaved anything but defensively in 2019, however. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) delivered a 25.9% total return last year - better than more than half the index\\'s sectors, including the revamped, \"growthier\" communications sector and consumer discretionary stocks.That\\'s surely a pleasant surprise for utility-stock investors. Many enter the sector looking not for growth, but stability in down markets and the dependable dividends these companies can afford thanks to the often regulated nature of the utility business.Like most of the market, utility stocks did get stretched as a result of their 2019 run. \"The utility sector currently trades at a P/E of 19.3x, versus a 15-year historical average of 15.01x, which represents a 29% premium to the S&P; 500,\" Michael Sheldon, executive director and CIO of financial planner RDM Financial Group, told Kiplinger in a December email.While Sheldon is concerned about the sector\\'s valuation, he\\'s also quick to point out that many utility stocks have low beta - a measure of volatility. Thus, they\\'re still providing more stability compared to the overall market.Here are 10 of the best utility stocks to buy for 2020. This isn\\'t your usual group of utilities, either. While some of these names should be expected to provide a traditional combination of dividend income and lower volatility, a few are set up for potential growth thanks to their connection to green-energy initiatives.

US-based Brex, the $2.6 billion-valued corporate credit card startup, is planning to broaden its product suite beyond its core banking services, reports Bank Innovation. The startup's newly appointed COO Paul-Henri Ferrand told the outlet that the three-year-old company aims to bolster its existing service with the introduction of insurance, lending, and treasury products, though he didn't specify when. Brex, which launched publicly in June 2018, offers corporate credit cards to startups, a segment that's long been underserved by incumbent lenders. It expanded into banking in October 2019, with a limited rollout of a cash management account; Ferrand says Brex plans to roll out the product widely by the end of March 2020. Bolstering its product suite can help Brex deepen its relationship with its clients and reap more revenue from its user base.\""

Fiserv recorded almost $3.7 billion in internal revenue in Q4 2019, growing 5% year-over-year (YoY), per the company's earnings release . First Data, which Fiserv acquired for $22 billion in a deal that closed in July 2019, contributed 61% of the total company's internal revenue in the quarter — worth over $2.2 billion — and grew 6% YoY. With First Data driving both Fiserv's revenue and growth in Q4 2019, it's set up to be a core part of the business for years to come. Fiserv appears set to find new short- and long-term revenue opportunities thanks to the acquisition. The company believes it's on track to bring in at least $100 million in revenue synergies in 2020, Frank Bisignano, Fiserv COO and former First Data CEO, said on the company's earnings call . Being able to combine First Data's offerings, like Clover — which increased its annualized gross payment volume (GPV) by over 40% YoY, according to Fiserv CEO Jeff Yabuki — as well as both firms' processing capabilities and existing relationships should enable Fiserv to attract new clients and cross-sell to existing ones.\""

      "Apple today released iOS 13.3, the third major update to the iOS and iPadOS 13 operating systems. The new software updates come two weeks after the release of iOS/iPadOS 13.2.3 and more than a month after the launch of iOS 13.2 , which brought new emoji. The iOS and ‌‌‌iPadOS‌‌‌ 13.3 updates are available on all eligible devices over-the-air in the Settings app. To access the updates, go to Settings > General > Software Update. iOS 13.3 continues to add features that were originally promised for iOS 13 but were ultimately eliminated during the beta testing process, with the update introducing Communication Limits for Screen Time. Communication Limits let parents control who their children are able to contact, with the feature covering FaceTime, Phone, Messages, and iCloud Contacts. Calls to emergency numbers are always allowed and when placed, will turn off communication limits for 24 hours to make sure children are safe and not restricted from communicating with people in the event of an emergency.\n",
      "The Coolest Cooler launched on Kickstarter in 2014 and raised over $13 million from backers. The idea was to sell a \"portable party disguised as a cooler,\" complete with Bluetooth speakers, a blender, and storage for dishes and utensils. The project struggled to actually launch for years, and now the company is officially going out of business before all backers even received the product. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. The Coolest Cooler had a promising start on Kickstarter five years ago, but things have been rocky since. Though it was once the most-funded project on Kickstarter, it went on to become somewhat infamous for failure to deliver and constant updates from the creator about pushing back shipping dates. The Verge calls Coolest Cooler \"the biggest disaster on Kickstarter.\" To date, there have been 56 updates posted on the page. Here's how the project went from $13 million in funding to shutting down 5 years later, with one-third of customers never receiving the cooler they were promised.\n"

       "'Qualcomm Inc, the world’s top mobile chip supplier, said India must not go slow on 5G as deployment of this next-gen wireless broadband technology will determine its economic fortunes, competitiveness and the fate of its local manufacturing ambitions. The company’s president Cristiano Amon told ET’s Kalyan Parbat that the US chipmaker’s 2020 plans include making its 5G chipsets available in the average $250-350 price band from current $1000-plus levels, to drive affordability. Edited excerpts.5G devices phones powered by Qualcomm’s latest 5G mobile chip, the Snapdragon 865, will be commercially available by early-2020. But India, a key market for Qualcomm, is yet to even go 5G. Does that bother you?No, it doesn’t, because unlike 3G and 4G, 5G wireless technology is not unique to public (telecom) networks alone, and India can take advantage of that. While it may take longer for telcos to build 5G (with spectrum auctions yet to happen), India could start with private 5G networks for university campuses, enterprises, industries, and in turn, leverage the transformative power of 5G.'"

       "\"The world’s cheapest 5G phone costs just $285, but you might not be able to buy it After years of talking about 5G, carriers have finally rolled out 5G networks in 2019 and started selling several handsets ready to support the faster data transfers. However, most of these phones are more expensive than their 4G equivalents, and buying one makes little sense unless you happen to live or work in the vicinity of those few places where 5G actually works. Come 2020, however, 5G phones will become even more affordable, just as 5G coverage expands around the world. And it all starts with a 5G phone that costs only $285. Sadly, it might not be available in your market anytime soon. Not only is the Redmi K30 ready to support 5G out of the box, but the phone will also rock a 120Hz 6.67-inch screen, which is the kind of screen refresh rate that you’d see on a gaming Android handset or some of this year’s flagship handsets. The phone's design is similar to Samsung’s Galaxy S10+. We’re looking at a hole-punch all-screen display, although the edges aren’t curved.\""
